# YimMenu Launchpad

[YimMenu](https://github.com/YimMenu/YimMenu), a GTA V menu protecting against a wide ranges of the public crashes and improving the overall experience.

YimMenu is in my opinion the best **free** GTA V mod menu, its protections are at the level of a paid menu, you have lots of trolling options, amazing scripts from the community, etc.

## Why this project?

YimMenu does not have an official launcher, so imagine you are a YimMenu user, and like every day you log in to GTA V and inject your menu. But something strange happens, many of the functions don't work, so you go to the site, download it again and inject it and now it works. What has happened is that they have clearly released a new version of the menu and you didn't have it downloaded.

Seeing this problem, I decided to make a launchpad for the menu with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Kivy](https://kivy.org/).

## How to use

To use the launchpad you have to download the latest version from the releases and execute the `.exe`.
The first thing you have to do is click on `Update`, wait a second for the pop-up and if nothing goes wrong you can press `Inject` with the game open, obviously.
